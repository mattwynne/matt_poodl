# Checkerboard

This is a refactoring drill. A drill is common in other fields,
such as sports, music, and chess. It is characterised by:

* focus
* repetition
* feedback

In this exercise, the tests provide the rapid and continuous feedback
-- but no more than that. In other words, the tests will not serve a
design purpose (this is not TDD).

Run the test suite with the following command:

```ruby
$ ruby test/checkerboard_test.rb
```

Make the first test pass with the simplest code possible.

Once that test is passing, refactor in tiny steps.
The test should not ever fail. Refactor until you can unskip
the second test and have it be passing already.
